E-Commerce Sales Analysis – October 2019

---

Objective

To analyze online user purchasing behavior from a real e-commerce platform in October 2019, focusing on product revenue contribution and revenue trends over time.

---

Dataset Overview

* Source: Kaggle - E-Commerce Behavior Data from Multi-Category Store
* Volume: \~42 million rows total (filtered to 549,507 purchase rows for Oct 2019)
* Columns used: `event_time`, `product_id`, `price`, `user_id`, `event_type`
* Filtered by: `event_type == 'purchase'`

---

Methodology

* Loaded a 2GB CSV file in 100,000-row chunks using `pandas.read_csv(..., chunksize=...)`
* Cleaned data: removed missing values, converted `event_time` to datetime
* Filtered only purchase events for analysis
* Aggregated purchase data to calculate:

  * Top revenue-generating products
  * Daily revenue trends
* Visualized insights using matplotlib bar and line charts

---

Key Insights**

Top Products by Revenue

* The top 10 products each generated over \$2M in revenue.
* The single highest-grossing product ID: **1005151**, which drove over \$12M in revenue alone.
* Revenue is highly concentrated — top 10 products account for a large share of total monthly revenue, suggesting a **Pareto effect (80/20 rule)**.

Daily Revenue Trends

* Peak sales occurred around **October 15–17**, with revenue reaching \~\$8.9M/day.
* After mid-month, revenue gradually declined, possibly due to promotion cycles ending.
* Sales remained relatively strong during the first 2 weeks and dropped toward the end of the month.
