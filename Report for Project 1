Key Findings
Insight	Explanation
+,Revenue Peaks	Mid-October showed the most revenue activity, possibly tied to a marketing event or sale.
+,Product Concentration	A small group of SKUs drives the majority of revenue.
+,Trend Suggestion	Revenue tapers off steadily — consider end-of-month promotions to balance sales.
